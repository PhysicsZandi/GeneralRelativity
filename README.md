# Simulation of the Ising model with networks

In this repository, you will find a python implementation to compute geometrical quantities of general relativity.

# Schwarzschild metric

1. in [Schwarzschild](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/GeneralRelativity/blob/main/Schwarzschild.ipynb), you will find computations for the Schwarzschild metric;

# FRW metric

2. in [FRW](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/GeneralRelativity/blob/main/FRW.ipynb), you will find computations for the FRW metric;

# RN metric

3. in [RN](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/GeneralRelativity/blob/main/RN.ipynb), you will find computations for the RN metric.
