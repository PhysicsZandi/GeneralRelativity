# Simulation of the Ising model with networks

In this repository, you will find a python implementation to compute geometrical quantities of general relativity.

# Schwarzschild metric

1. in [Schwarzschild](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/Schwarzschild.ipynb), you will find an example with the Schwarzschild metric.

# FRW metric

2. in [FRW](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/FRW.ipynb), you will find an example with the FRW metric.
